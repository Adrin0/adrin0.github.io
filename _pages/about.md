Hi, I’m **Adrian Padron** — a cybersecurity & AI-minded technologist who currently works in guest relations at **Caltech’s Athenaeum** while building out a serious homelab and career in security, AI engineering, and data-driven systems.

I like connecting three worlds:

- **Cybersecurity & Infrastructure** – network security, SIEM labs, Proxmox, and “breaking things safely” in virtual environments.
- **AI & Automation** – using models to streamline workflows, analyze systems, and make boring tasks disappear.
- **Hospitality & People** – translating tech into smooth experiences for real humans (guests, coworkers, and future teammates).

### What I’m doing right now

- Working at **Caltech’s Athenaeum** in guest relations — front-of-house operations, problem solving, and learning how complex organizations actually run.
- Building **“Hadron-Home”**, my Proxmox-based homelab:
  - A NAS and backup strategy for personal data  
  - A virtual lab for cybersecurity experiments  
  - Infrastructure to run local AI models for tinkering and automation
- Developing **cybersecurity projects**: SIEM/ELK monitoring, threat-intelligence integration (MISP), and custom lab environments for detection & response.
- Studying and experimenting with **AI engineering** (Azure, local LLMs) and how they can be used for:
  - Resume / career tooling  
  - Operational automation (like hotel/club workflows)  
  - Security monitoring and anomaly detection

### A few highlight projects

- **Hadron-Home Proxmox Lab**  
  A home server running Proxmox that hosts:
  - A virtualized SIEM (ELK stack) to monitor a deliberately vulnerable web app  
  - A Kali “jumpbox” for testing  
  - Plans for local LLM deployment and network monitoring
- **Athenaeum Email Automation (design concept)**  
  A proposed system to:
  - Extract guest emails from legacy PDF exports  
  - Route them into a central workflow  
  - Send confirmation emails from a shared mailbox  
  - Reduce manual handling and errors while respecting security and privacy
- **Cybersecurity Labs & Blue-Team Exercises**  
  Hands-on labs using ELK, MISP, and vulnerable VMs to simulate real-world incidents, tune detections, and practice investigation workflow.

You’ll find more details on these on the **Projects** page.

### Longer-term direction

Over the next few years, I’m aiming to:

- Move into a role that blends **security, AI, and systems design**.
- Keep evolving my homelab into a real-world sandbox for:
  - Network defense  
  - Automation workflows  
  - Data/security-driven experiments
- Explore how **privacy, Web3 concepts, and decentralized infrastructure** can give everyday people more control over their data.

If you’re working on anything at the intersection of **security, AI, or complex systems**, feel free to reach out — I’m always down to trade ideas.
